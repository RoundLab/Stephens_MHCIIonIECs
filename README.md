# 16S rRNA sequence processing code, metadata and QIIME2 result files for the paper "Epithelial-myeloid exchange of MHCII constrains immunity and microbiota composition". 

## Contents

- **code**: Contains shell scripts used for processing of raw, demultiplexed sequence data to ASV tables, representative sequence files, taxonomies and phylogenies. Uses Singularity to call QIIME2.
- **metadata**: Metadata map files for each sequencing run.
- **results**: Key QIIME2 artifact files resulting from processing of raw data. 

## Experiments

This repository contains 4 separate sequencing experiments described in the publication. 18684R used a different 16S targeting primer set than the other 3 (seqs noted in processing scripts).

1. Ileal microbiome sequencing, separately housed and cohoused genotypes: Run #18684R
2. Ileal microbiome sequencing during DSS-colitis: Run #12095R
3. Individually housed mice 4-7 weeks of age: Run #13590R
4. Fecal microbiome, separately house by genotypes: Run #11840R
